# C - Binary trees

This was initially designed as a team project but I have done it alone because I did not get a partner before the starting date. However, I learned about the details, advantages,
and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. I learned about how to
qualify trees as well as how to traverse them. Throughout the project, I
implemented binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.
